# @hebcal/hebcal-rs

**This is still a work in progress and not everything is implemented.**

[![Build Status](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This project is a Rust implementation of the Hebcal calendar. It is a perpetual calendar that can calculate the date of any Jewish holiday or festival, given a Gregorian date. The code is a fork of the [Hebcal for JS](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-es6/) project, which was written in JavaScript.

The project is currently in development, and the API is subject to change. However, the core functionality of calculating dates should be stable.

## Installation

To install the Hebcal Rust library, you can add it to your project's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
hebcal = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage and API

- [ ] TBD
